# Security Checklist

An interactive RMF-style assessment tool for OpenClaw deployments. Walk through every hardening control, mark compliance status, and track your security posture.

**How it works:** Select a deployment profile to pre-filter controls by relevance. Expand each control to see the risk, recommendation, and verification command. Mark each as Compliant, Non-Compliant, or N/A. Your progress is saved in your browser automatically.
